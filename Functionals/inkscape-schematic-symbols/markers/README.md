# How to use the markers.svg file

Place the file markers.svg in the directory

 * Program Files/Inkscape/share/markers (Windows)
 * /usr/share/inkscape/markers (Linux)

You need Admin rights to overwrite the original markers.svg. The new
markers.svg file provided here should contain all the default markers shipped
with Inkscape plus some additional ones that are useful for drawing schematics.
If you are in doubt, you should create a backup copy of the original
markers.svg before.

Afterwards, new markers (gnd, port, etc.) are available system-wide.
